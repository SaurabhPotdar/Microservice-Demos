@LoadBalanced RestTemplate provides a Ribbon backed RestTemplate which we can use with Eureka alone.

But if we use Eureka with Ribbon, then Eureka will override Ribbon's health checks.
List of servers, health checks is performed by Eureka for Ribbon.
We can also use Ribbon alone
@RibbonClient(name="a") --> Annotation over Controller or FeignClient interface.
a.eureka.enabled: false
a.eureka.listOfServers: localhost:8090,localhost:9092,localhost:9999
